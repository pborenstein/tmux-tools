# Development Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines planned improvements and enhancements for tmux-tools, building on the modular architecture established in the recent refactoring. Items are categorized by implementation complexity and user impact.

## Current Status

Following the comprehensive refactoring completed in September 2025, tmux-tools now has:

- Modular library architecture with shared components
- Unified command interface (`tmux-tools`)
- YAML configuration system with multiple themes
- Backward compatibility with original scripts
- Color theming system with accessibility support

## Immediate Improvements (Current Release Cycle)

### Minor Issues Resolution

**Priority**: High | **Effort**: Low | **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

   - Add tmux version compatibility checks
   - Improve client data error handling for `tmux list-clients` failures
   - Add graceful degradation when tmux server becomes unavailable
   - Better error messages with suggested remediation

2. **Display Refinements**
   - Column width constraints for session names (>13 chars), window names (>8 chars), and commands (>7 chars)
   - Path truncation for very long paths to prevent line wrapping
   - Smart truncation with ellipsis in middle of paths
   - Consistent column alignment across terminal sizes

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Cache client data instead of repeated grep searches
   - Batch tmux queries for large session counts
